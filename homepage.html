  <h1>Welcome to Leaf Literacy!! We talk all things pot!!</h1>
  <p>lets talk....</p>

  <h2>What we do...</h2>
  <p>Marijuania is a powerful psychoactive drug that when properly used has many medicinal 
    benefits that have been continuously outweighing the deep rooted stigma on the medicinal 
    benefits from consumption. While pot can have many medicinal effects it is still easily 
    abused leading to its harsh nickname, “The Gateway Drug”. Our goal is to educate consumers 
    on just what they are putting into their bodies and how they might end up feeling because of it.</p>

  <h3 id="Understanding"> Understanding The "Nug"</h3>
  <p>Nugs or the "Cola" of the plant are the flower part of marijuania, 
    they are what carries most of the THC within the whole plant.
  Below is a Diagram of a plant hilighting the aspects of the Nug: </p>
