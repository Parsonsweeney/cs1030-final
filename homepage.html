  <h1 id="homepage">Welcome to Leaf Literacy!! We talk all things pot!!</h1>

  
  <p>Marijuania is a powerful psychoactive drug that when properly used has many medicinal 
    benefits that have been continuously outweighing the deep rooted stigma on the medicinal 
    benefits from consumption. While pot can have many medicinal effects it is still easily 
    abused leading to its harsh nickname, “The Gateway Drug”. Our goal is to educate consumers 
    on just what they are putting into their bodies and the effects they might end up feeling because of it.</p>
    <p><b> Understanding the “classifications” for cannabis strains:</b>
Indica and Sativa have been the 2 main ways to classify marijuania for as long as the drug has
 been studied. Indica is said to have a more relaxing and sedative effect on the body with earthier
  aromas. Whereas Sativa is more of a stimulant meant to boost energy and has a sweeter 
  aroma(a fun way to remember the difference is when thinking indica, think indacouch). However,
   in the current world stain types are ALL more hybrid than they are indica or sativa. 
   There are consistent new studies that keep drawing the same conclusion when attempting to compare the 2 strain types. 
Sophie Watts a PHD student in Plant, Food and Environmental Sciences at Dalhousie University 
has written a paper on the improper comparison of indica and sativa stains. They compared the genetics 
of different indica and sativa stains where they found inconsistencies throughout the history of the labeling 
of stains that she called the “telephone” effect. They concluded that current marijuania strains consistently 
have strong genetic ties to both indica and sativa stains ruling them ALL as hybrids. They even found cases where 
a stain was originally classed as indica and then was later classed as a sativa. “An example that illustrates the 
inconsistent use of these labels is that in 1999, a cannabis strain named “AK 47” won the Sativa Cup in the Cannabis Cup. 
The same strain went on to win the Indica Cup in the same competition four years later.”  While genetically there is almost 
no difference in these strains, the effects of each stain can be very different, so it is important to know that indica sativa 
and hybrid are more of an “effect” category and less of a genetic identifier. In general marijuania with a higher cbd % will tend to have a more mellowing effect. 
While the genetic variation within the many strains of cannabis has become less unique there are still vastly different in 
terms of the medicinal effects it has, in general it can be understood that marujania with higher CBD% tend to have a more
 “mellowing” effect that's often associated with the indica classification. We use this as well as other information to highlight
  the likely medicinal  effects of bud and wax products.

  <h2>What is Cannabis?</h2>
  <p>Cannabis is a type of flower plant also known as marijuania. There are hundreds of different
     strains that the drug comes in and new genetic variants are constantly being made. All of which
      are classified into 3 main categories; indica, sativa, hybrids. The intensity of the drug heavily 
      depends on the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) they have due to the 
      psychoactive properties within the cannabinoids. The distinct flavor/aroma of each strain is 
      dependent on the terpenes. So when smoking something with a distinct taste and smell it can be 
      said that it's a very terpy strain. </p>

  <h3 id="Understanding"> Understanding The "Nug"</h3>
  <p>Nugs or the "Cola" of the plant are the flower part of marijuania, 
    they are what carries most of the THC within the whole plant.
