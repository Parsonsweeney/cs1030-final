  <p>What we do...</p>
  <p>Marijuania is a powerful psychoactive drug that when properly used has many medicinal 
    benefits that have been continuously outweighing the deep rooted stigma on the medicinal 
    benefits from consumption. While pot can have many medicinal effects it is still easily 
    abused leading to its harsh nickname, “The Gateway Drug”. Our goal is to educate consumers 
    on just what they are putting into their bodies and the effects they might end up feeling because of it.</p>

  <h2>What is Cannabis?</h2>
  <p>Cannabis is a type of flower plant also known as marijuania. There are hundreds of different
     strains that the drug comes in and new genetic variants are constantly being made. All of which
      are classified into 3 main categories; indica, sativa, hybrids. The intensity of the drug heavily 
      depends on the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) they have due to the 
      psychoactive properties within the cannabinoids. The distinct flavor/aroma of each strain is 
      dependent on the terpenes. So when smoking something with a distinct taste and smell it can be 
      said that it's a very terpy strain. </p>
  

  <h3 id="Understanding"> Understanding The "Nug"</h3>
  <p>Nugs or the "Cola" of the plant are the flower part of marijuania, 
    they are what carries most of the THC within the whole plant.
