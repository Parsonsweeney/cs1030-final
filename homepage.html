  <h1 id="homepage">Welcome to Leaf Literacy!! We talk all things pot!!</h1>

  
  <p>Marijuania is a powerful psychoactive drug that when properly used has many medicinal 
    benefits that have been continuously outweighing the deep rooted stigma on the medicinal 
    benefits from consumption. While pot can have many medicinal effects it is still easily 
    abused leading to its harsh nickname, “The Gateway Drug”. Our goal is to educate consumers 
    on just what they are putting into their bodies and the effects they might end up feeling because of it.</p>
    
  <h2>What is Cannabis?</h2>
  <p>Cannabis is a type of flower plant also known as marijuania. There are hundreds of different
     strains that the drug comes in and new genetic variants are constantly being made. All of which
      are classified into 3 main categories; indica, sativa, hybrids. The intensity of the drug heavily 
      depends on the amount of <b>tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD)</b> they have due to the 
      psychoactive properties within the cannabinoids. The distinct flavor/aroma of each strain is 
      dependent on the terpenes. So when smoking something with a distinct taste and smell it can be 
      said that it's a very terpy strain. </p>
  <p><b> Understanding the “classifications” for cannabis strains:</b>
Indica and Sativa have been the 2 main ways to classify marijuania for as long as the drug has
 been studied. Indica is said to have a more relaxing and sedative effect on the body with earthier
  aromas. Whereas Sativa is more of a stimulant meant to boost energy and has a sweeter 
  aroma(a fun way to remember the difference is when thinking indica, think indacouch). However,
   in the current world stain types are ALL more hybrid than they are indica or sativa. 
   There are consistent new studies that keep drawing the same conclusion when attempting to compare the 2 strain types. 
Sophie Watts a PHD student in Plant, Food and Environmental Sciences at Dalhousie University 
has written a paper on the improper comparison of indica and sativa stains. They compared the genetics 
of different indica and sativa stains where they found inconsistencies throughout the history of the labeling 
of stains that she called the “telephone” effect. They concluded that current marijuania strains consistently 
have strong genetic ties to both indica and sativa stains ruling them ALL as hybrids. They even found cases where 
a stain was originally classed as indica and then was later classed as a sativa. “An example that illustrates the 
inconsistent use of these labels is that in 1999, a cannabis strain named “AK 47” won the Sativa Cup in the Cannabis Cup. 
The same strain went on to win the Indica Cup in the same competition four years later.”  While genetically there is almost 
no difference in these strains, the effects of each stain can be very different, so it is important to know that indica sativa 
and hybrid are more of an “effect” category and less of a genetic identifier. In general marijuania with a higher cbd % will tend to have a more mellowing effect. 
While the genetic variation within the many strains of cannabis has become less unique there are still vastly different in 
terms of the medicinal effects it has, in general it can be understood that marujania with higher CBD% tend to have a more
 “mellowing” effect that's often associated with the indica classification. We use this as well as other information to highlight
  the likely medicinal  effects of bud and wax products.

      <h3 id="Understanding"> Understanding The "Nug"</h3>
      <p>Nugs or the "Cola" of the plant are the flower part of marijuania, 
    they are what carries most of the THC within the whole plant.

      <p><b>Different ways of consumption(Bud): </b> Smoking bud is the original, the first 
        and often most preferred form of cannabis. But since the first “joint”(grided bud rolled 
        into a cigarette shape and smoked like a cigarette.) many new ways to smoke bud have been created. 
        We recommend trying all of them because it all really comes down to preference, but here are the most 
        common ways cannabis flower/bud is consumed:
      </p>
      <p><b>Joints:</b> the original way of smoking bud, the most common way people consume bud is through 
        the use of joints, they maximize flavor when smoking but will create a lot of smell due to the constant
         burning of the joint. </p>
      <p><b>Pipes:</b>The second most common way bud is consumed is by using pipes, wooden pipes came first but have
         quickly been replaced by artistic glass pieces. They allow for a quicker more convenient use compared to joints, 
         but can often be harsh.</p>
      <p><b>Bongs:</b>For consumers that like the convenience of packing a bowl in a pipe but want to take larger smoother hits 
        often resort to bongs. Often due to them being cleanable and more resistant to heat they're made out of glass but they also
         come in wood, bamboo, and plastic forms. Bongs are considered water pipes, they use water to cool the smoke that is being 
         pulled into the piece that when inhaled will be less harsh(smoother) on the throat.</p>
      <p><b>E-Devices:</b>e-devices are a game changer for cannabis consumers, they come in just about every shape and size, ranging 
        from large “volcano” diffusers, to small hand held devices. They allow for maximum convenience and very controlled hits, as
         well as the reduction of the strong  smell associated with cannabis. </p>

  <h3 id="dabbing">Dabbleing in Dabbing:</h3>
  <p>Smoking bud is not the only way cannabis can be consumed, there is also the 
    concentrate form which can either be smoked or eaten. Concentrates are made using 
    multiple processes to get 2 different types:solventless concentrates, solvent-based concentrates.
</p>
  <p><b>Solventless Extraction:</b>In solventless extraction physical processes like heat, pressure, and water are used to separate the compounds.
</p>
  <p><b>Solvent-Based Extraction:</b>In solvent-base extraction chemicals like butane, propane, or CO2 to strip cannabinoids and terpenes from the plant.
</p>
  <p>The difference between these 2 ways of extraction is in the yield from flower to concentrate and the quality of the flower being used. 
    In solvent-based extraction the yield is a lot higher compared to solventless and lower quality buds can be processed using this method. 
    While it provides a higher yield due to the chemicals pulling more of the plant's cannabinoids the quality of the wax is alot lower than 
    the quality of solventless concentrates, there are also many harmful chemicals used in solvent-based extraction that can cause damage to 
    consumers. What you should conclude from solventless and solvent-based(BHO) extraction is that, BHO will be cheaper and easier to get but 
    is made using harmful chemicals and lower quality plants, whereas solventless products like rosin are the cleaner and more natural form of 
    concentrate that will hold a lot more flavor than any BHO at a higher cost due to the lower yield in the extraction process.
